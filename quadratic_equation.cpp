Question 18: Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form
                                ax2 + bx + c = 0
If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. Remember, researching how
to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it. Use doubles for the
user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2.

Approach to solve the question:
    1. check if the quadratic equation has roots.
    2. If the quadratic equation has roots, put the value of a, b, and c in the formula of finding roots.
    3. Print message if it has no roots.*/
